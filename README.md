The SOAJS Dashboard UI runs in the dashboard environment and offers an interface built using Angular JS that communicates with the microservices deployed in the dashboard environment: [URAC](https://soajsorg.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/URAC) - [oAuth](https://soajsorg.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OAUT/overview) - [DASHBOARD](https://soajsorg.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSBRD/overview)

## Installation
The dashboard UI is a simple angular js application consisting of HTML, CSS & Javascript and is installed once you deploy the soajs pipeline as shown in the [SOAJS installer](https://soajsorg.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IN).
Once the dashboard environment is deployed, you can access this interface via your browser by opening the domain you have entered for your project.
